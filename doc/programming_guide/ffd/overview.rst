Overview
********

This is the far-field voice local command (FFD) example design. Two examples are provided: both examples include a speech recognition and a local dictionary. One example use the Sensory TrulyHandsfreeâ„¢ (THF) libraries and one the Cyberon CListener libraries.

When a wakeword phrase is detected followed by a command phrase, the application will output an audio response and a discrete message over |I2C| and UART.

Sensory's THF software ships with an expiring development license. It will suspend recognition after 11.4 hours or 107 recognition events; after which, a device reset is required to resume normal operation. To perform a reset, either power cycle the device or press the SW2 button.

Cyberon's software only runs on a board with the correct OTP key.
