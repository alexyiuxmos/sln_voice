Overview
********

This is the low-power far-field voice local command (FFD) example design with Wanson speech recognition and local dictionary.

While inactive, low-power mode uses a fraction of energy otherwise required by normal operations while awaiting and processing speech.

When a wake-up phrase is followed by an command phrase, the application will output an audio response and a discrete message over |I2C| and UART.

This software is an evaluation version only.  It includes a mechanism that limits the maximum number of recognitions to 50. You can reset the counter to 0 by restarting or rebooting the application.  The application can be rebooted by power cycling or pressing the SW2 button.

.. note::
  Due to the hardware design, SW2 is only functional when in full-power operation.
